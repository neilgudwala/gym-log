This is a Gym Exercise Log App, it is primarily a backend project.

I have made basic frontend with HTML and CSS.
The backend has been made using JavaScript and Firebase APIs(v 10.3.1) while using Firestore Database to store the data.

My API keys are visible in this repo since I am submitting this for CRuX Inductions.

Requirements- No special requirements, just clone the app and run using Live Server.
